Scripting is another fundamental part of game creation. 

Scripting allows you to handle game events, respond to user inputs and control the movement and the behavior of your entities.
In short, it is what makes your static game interactive by adding a gameplay to it.

Below is an example of script in Xenko.

```cs
public class BasicAsyncScript : AsyncScript
{         
	public override async Task Execute() 
	{
		while(Game.IsRunning)
		{
			// Do some stuff every frame
			
			await Script.NextFrame();
		}
	}
 }
```

## Overview

All the scripting in Xenko is done in C#.

There are two main types of script in Xenko: Asynchronous and Synchronous Scripts.

The public fields of your scripts are displayed and can be setup from the Game Studio property grid.

A script can be created both from Visual Studio and the Game Studio.

You can use a script by instantiating and attaching it to an entity of your scene.
This can be done either from the scene editor or from the code.

To debug a script use Visual Studio and simply put a break point in the desired code section.
