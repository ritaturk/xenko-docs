# Particle Shape Builders

![media/particles-reference-shapebuilders-0.png](media/particles-reference-shapebuilders-0.png) 

Shape Builders create mesh shapes from the living particles so that they can be rendered. Currently only one type of shape can be assigned to an emitter.

## Billboard

Every particle is expanded to a 1 meter by 1 meter camera-facing quad. If the particle has any size, it is scaled accordingly. The billboards only support angular rotation.

## Hexagon

Every particle is expanded to a camera-facing hexagon with 0.5 meter sides. If the particle has any size, it is scaled accordingly. The hexagons only support angular rotation.

## Quad

Every particle is expanded to a 1 meter by 1 meter up-facing quad. If the particle has any size, it is scaled accordingly. The quads support 3D orientation and rotation.

The picture below shows a billboard, a hexagon and a quad:

## Direction Aligned Sprite

This sprite is a billboard which is aligned and stretched to the particle's direction. You can set initial direction for the particles with an initializer, or you can add an updater which writes particle speed as direction.

## Ribbon

The ribbon is a special kind of shape builder which draws several particles together, as a connected strip rather than individually. The ribbon is always camera-facing.

## Trail

The trail is a special kind of shape builder which draws several particles together, as a connected strip rather than individually. The trail is not camera-facing, but fixed in space.

## More

Meshes are also planned for future releases.
