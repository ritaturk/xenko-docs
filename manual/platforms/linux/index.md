##Creating a Linux Game

Create a new game in GameStudio and make sure to select Linux as one of the target platform.

Once you have done this, you just have to select Linux in the platform selector and press F5 to build and start the current project.

The first time you will need to enter information about your Linux host as shown below:

![Credential Dialog](media/default_credential_dialog.png)

When your information is entered as below:

![Filled Credential Dialog](media/filled_credential_dialog.png)

You should test your credentials by clicking the **Test settings** button. If you made an error, you will get

![Invalid Settings](media/unreachable_host.png)

When there is no error you will get:

![Success](media/successful_login.png)

Once you are done, click the **OK** button to continue. At this point, it will copy all the files over your Linux host in a subdirectory of the location you will have provided. The name of that subdirectory is the name of your game.

In the event something goes wrong, check the **Output** pane to get more details.

## Settings

All the credentials you will have entered the first time is saved in the Settings dialog:

![Settings Dialog](media/remote_settings.png)

The password is saved encrypted using the Micrsoft *System.Security.Cryptograph.ProtectedData.Protect* method for the current user and saved in Base64 which is displayed in the Settings. For the time being, one cannot change the password from the Settings dialog.

In addition to the credentials information you will have 2 additional settings that control the execution of a game:
* Use CoreCLR: force execution using .NET Core.
* X Display: force execution on a specific X display of your Linux host.
